# PokeMMOclassic

A Pokemon Red/Blue MMO, inspired by [maierfelix/PokeMMO](maierfelix/PokeMMO), though significantly smaller scope. I just want a Pokemon Red I can fight my friends in, yo.

Looking into [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) atm.

## Goals

- Local Resource Packs - Ability to add your own - IP laws, yo. I won't be containing any of the original pokemon artwork or music here, but you can for sure make your own!
- Recreate the same gameplay experience as the original Pokemon Red/Blue, including:
  - [ ] Login / save
  - [ ] Movement / Collisions
  - [ ] Buildings / rooms
  - [ ] NPCs
  - [ ] NPC trainers
  - [ ] Battles
  - [ ] Gyms/Badges
- Allow other players to join the world with you, beginning with PVP mode, maybe expanding to group battles.
- Allow players to set their own "realm", with invites/banning/etc.
